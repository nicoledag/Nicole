  <h1>Recommendations</h1>

 <div class="recommend-text">
   <p>Nicole was my associate project manager and direct report at Macy’s from 2011-2012. In addition I worked with her as part of the team her other years at Macy’s. She supported me in managing the buying and production calendars for all brands within my department. Nicole was the point person for me in the department and provided clear direction and guidance to other employees. Nicole was organized and adapted well to change in our fast paced environment and she also partnered with our speed-to-market team to test, train and implement an online calendar. I would highly recommend Nicole as a dedicated employee who consistently performed at a high level.</p>

  <p>Nicole worked for me at Macy’s in New Business Development as one of my account managers. She was a pleasure to work with! Nicole has an entrepreneurial spirit, is solutions oriented and extremely innovative. She came up with processes that streamlined our workload that were used through out the department years after she stopped working for me! She is determined, and embraces change. The fact that she decided to completely change careers is a testament to her ability to change and take calculated risks. Nicole would be an asset to any organization! </p>

  <p>I worked closely with Nicole at Macy's Merchandising Group in 2011-2012. Nicole was an effective leader assisting with my onboarding process as a new employee at Macy's. While I was on her team, she came up with several process improvements and tools that saved our team time, created efficiencies, and kept everyone organized. Nicole managed change well and was able to effectively and quickly implement department changes. She always had a positive attitude and was supportive of all of my ideas. I am confident Nicole would contribute greatly to any team she became a part of. </p>
